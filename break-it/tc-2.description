This testcase checks for empty map values. The nosj_parser does not correctly handle empty values and will eventually hit the recursion limit and crash. The root cause lies in how the values are handled recursively, specifically when a value is parsed it checks if the value is empty, if it is it will set it to the original input causing it to loop forever. To fix this check if the value is empty in parse_map() and return an error if the value is empty.
